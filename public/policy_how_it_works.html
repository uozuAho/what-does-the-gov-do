    <p>When you click on a policy in the <a href="mp_votes">MP votes page</a>,
    you are presented with a chart. This chart shows each party's support of the
    policy, based on the way that members of those parties have voted in
    parliament.</p>

    <p>The tables below the chart show the same information.</p>

    <h3>Agreement</h3>
    <p>How much each member supports a policy is determined by the 'agreement'
    number. In short, the more times they vote for a policy (rather than against
    it), the higher their agreement is. A simplified calculation:</p>
    <p>
      Agreement = 100 x (votes for a policy / total number of votes held for a policy)
    </p>

    <p>There are more details about how this works on They Vote For You. For
    example, see <a

    "voted consistently for" is worked out</a> for <a
