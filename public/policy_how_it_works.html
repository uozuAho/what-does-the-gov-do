    <h1>How to use the 'Policy' page</h1>

    <p>When you click on a policy in the <a href="mp_votes">MP votes page</a>,
    you are presented with a chart. This chart shows each party's support of the
    policy, based on the way that members of those parties have voted in
    parliament.</p>

    <p>The tables below the chart show the same information.</p>

    <h3>Agreement</h3>
    <p>How much each member supports a policy is determined by the 'agreement'
    number. In short, the more times they vote for a policy (rather than against
    it), the higher their agreement is. Very roughly:</p>
    <p>
      Agreement ~= 100 x (votes for a policy / total number of votes held for a policy)
    </p>

    <h3>Electorates</h3>
    <p>The policy page also shows the electorates of the MPs who have voted. You
    only have the ability to vote for candidates in your electorate, however you
    may notice that MPs rarely vote against their party. This is why knowing a
    party's stance is important!
    </p>
    <h4>What is my electorate?</h4>
    <p>The easiest way to find out is to type your postcode into the search box
    on <a href="https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/">They Vote For You</a>'s
    homepage. The <a href="https://electorate.aec.gov.au/">AEC</a> is a more
    authoritative source, but their search feature is worse :). Note that these
    searches find your electorate, which corresponds to the 'Lower House', or
    House of Representatives. There is also the Senate. You vote for senators to
    represent the state or territory you live in. For more details on how voting
    works, see <a
    href="https://iamwoz.com/blog/20211225_how_aus_federal_elections_work/">How
    Australian federal elections work</a>
    </p>

    <p>There are more details about how this works on They Vote For You. For
    example, see <a

    "voted consistently for" is worked out</a> for <a

    Griff</a> on the policy <a

    Anti-Corruption Commission</a>.
