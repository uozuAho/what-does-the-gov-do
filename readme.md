# What does the government do?

# Dev: getting started
Install nodejs. Then:

```sh
npm i -g netlify-cli
npm i
ntl login
ntl link
ntl dev
```

# To do
- annotate screenshot in 'how it works' page
- loading indicators
- test on phone
## feedback
- policy list is overwhelming. show me policies grouped by area of concern
- once click on a policy: show in big center text: this is the policy, what it means
- better 'for against' indicator text/images
- colour on chart shoulkd also be displayed in table
## nice to have
- chart
  - disable zoom
  - fit to screen
- html templating tool. eg
  - nav bar is repetitive
  - changing links is tedious and error prone
