# What does the government do?

# Dev: getting started
Install nodejs. Then:

```sh
npm i -g netlify-cli
npm i
ntl login
ntl link
ntl dev
```

# To do
- change 'policy' to 'votes'?
- make policy list less overwhelming
- don't collapse nav bar
- docs: where the data is from, what it means
- how to contact me for errors etc.
## feedback
- policy list is overwhelming. show me policies grouped by area of concern
- once click on a policy: show in big center text: this is the policy, what it means
- better 'for against' indicator text/images
## nice to have
- loading indicator
- policy details: show all members' agreement in a table below the chart, ie
  no click handler
- test on phone
- chart
  - disable zoom
  - fit to screen
